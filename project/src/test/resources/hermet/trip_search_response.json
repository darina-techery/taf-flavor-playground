"description": "Hungary’s capital city lies upon the tranquil Danube River and is undeniably one of the most beautiful destinations in Europe. Vienna Gate Square’s Baroque churches and Rococo homes serve as an idyllic backdrop for bustling city streets, cafes, clubs and boutiques. Major attractions include the Buda Castle (also known as the Royal Palace or Royal Castle), Hungarian Parliament Building, the Great Synagogue and the Hercules Villa. <br><br>Due to its location over an expansive geothermic cave system, Budapest has an unusual amount of hot springs — more than 100. As a result, bathhouses are easily found across the city. Soaking in the relaxing waters is a classic Budapest tradition, a pastime leftover from the city’s lengthy period of Turkish occupation.<br><br>Hungarian art nouveau architecture is prominent in Budapest and was heavily influenced by eastern styles in the late 19th century, like those found in Syrian and Indian art of the same period.<br>",

"description": "Discover what being a DreamTrips™ Member is all about on this Welcome DreamTrip to Shanghai, China. Visit the 1,700-year-old town of Zhujiajiao, and take in its well-preserved ancient buildings, rock bridges, alleyways and canals – this ancient water town is considered Shanghai’s Venice. Interesting sights include Kezhi Garden, North Street, a Qing Dynasty post office and Yuanjin Buddhist Temple. After lunch, stop at the Bund, a popular waterfront that offers scenic views of skyscrapers and the river. Before dinner, stroll through the Chenghuang Temple market area full of vendor stalls, tea shops and street food sellers.<br><br><strong>What we love:</strong><br>•\tZhujiajiao is nicknamed “Pearl Stream,” thanks to a shining pearl that’s part of the decoration on an iconic stone arch bridge.<br>•\tThe architectural styles of the buildings that line the Bund range from baroque revival to art deco. <br>•\tThe Chenghuang Temple, or “City God Temple,” is a Taoist temple and comprises several palaces, halls and gardens.<br><br>",

"description": "Hong Kong is an intense, eclectic city that draws millions of visitors \r\nannually thanks to its fascinating blend of modern culture and ancient \r\ntradition. This Pearl River Delta metropolis is one of a kind, an \r\nautonomous territory known as much for its iconic harbor skyline as its \r\nplentiful skyscrapers. Beneath its industrial- and business-focused \r\nexterior, this bustling city hides a treasure trove of unique \r\nexperiences just begging to be discovered. Few cities are better for \r\nfeasting — the cuisine here is truly global. And thanks to the city’s \r\nChinese roots and British colonial background, there’s also an amazing \r\nrange of historical, military and contemporary landmarks. There’s no \r\nshortage of entertainment and sights to see in Hong Kong — everything \r\nfrom opera to glitzy malls, and from sprawling parks to museums — \r\nearning the city the nickname, “Asia’s World City.”",
